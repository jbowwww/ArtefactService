- Should have bloody backed up a few hours ago as I had queries working quite well. Got around my problem with FileSystemArtefacatCreator trying to serialize
temporary types as part of a MemberAccessExpression (e.g. for (a as Drive).Label == driveInfo[i].VolumeLabel)
- So, to get it working again as it was a few hours ago, I think I need to:
	- Queryable<> should implement an Artefacts.Services.IQueryable<> that inherits from System.Linq.IQueryable<>, defines additional member TOtalCount
	- I removed a Server-side NHQueryableProxy<> that implemented Artefacts.Services.IQueryable<> as well, reimplement this and ArtefactRepository.Artefacts should
	 be an instance of this on the server side. Client side is an instance of QUeryable<> 
- An issue that remains is how to handle expressions that return types other than IQueryable<>/IEnumerable<> ? e.g. Count() First() FirstOrDefault()
	- I think this is what I was experimenting with when I broke the functionality I had achieved
