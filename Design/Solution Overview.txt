Trying to approach things a bit top-down this time around at least to start with

	-	Not entirely decided about whether the classes Artefact, ArtefactLibrary, ArtefactRepository & their interfaces
		need to be in different projects / output to separate DLLs, for now I guess it doesn't really matter
		
		-	There will be a separate project and executable (or maybe eventually a DLL) for the service HOST
